# SolStretch
SolStretch is a Shiny app for applying decorrelation stretch to RGB raster images (JPEG or TIFF). It enhances visual contrast using PCA-based transformation.  Originally designed to support the study and digital enhancement of parietal art and rock paintings, it may also be useful in other visual analysis contexts.
